---------------------------------------

Over-representation analysis (ORA) is a critical technique to determine if a set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) is enriched with genes from specific gene sets or pathways. However, the cut-off used to define the number of DEGs that are utilised significantly impacts ORA results. To overcome the arbitrary choice of a cut-off and identify cut-off-independent enriched pathways, we developed PEBBA. This user-friendly tool ranks genes based on their statistical and biological significance and then systematically performs ORA for different cut-offs. There is no need to shortlist genes or waste time fine-tuning parameters. By simplifying ORA, PEBBA can be employed to lighten usersâ€™ burdens concerning parameter choice and decrease false positives. By visually exploring the parameter space, users can draw more precise conclusions about their dataset.

## Install
PEBBA may be installed through pip: `pip install pebba`.
Alternatively, PEBBA is also available as an online tool at [pebba.sysbio.tools](https://pebba.sysbio.tools/)


## Using pebba
Once installed, pebba can be used as a standalone module:

`python -m pebba <deg_file> <gmt_file>`


For more options use the --help flag: `python -m pebba --help`
